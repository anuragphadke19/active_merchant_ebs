= ActiveMerchantEbs

EBS integration for ActiveMerchant.

== Installation

=== Requirements

You need to install the ActiveMerchant gem or rails plugin. More info about ActiveMerchant installation can be found at http://www.activemerchant.org.

=== As a gem

Install the gem [recommended]:

  > gem install active_merchant_ebs  

To use the ActiveMerchantEbs gem in a Rails 3 application, add the following line in your Gemfile:

  gem 'active_merchant_ebs'

== Configuration

Create a merchant account with EBS.

Then create an initializer, like initializers/payment.rb. Add the following lines:

  ActiveMerchant::Billing::Integrations::Ebs.setup do |ebs|
    ebs.account_id =  #your EBS account ID
    ebs.mode = 'TEST' #EBS Mode 'TEST' or 'LIVE'
    ebs.secret_key = 'your secret key' #Provided by EBS
  end
  EBS_ACCOUNT = 'youraccountname'
  

If ActiveMerchant's actionview helpers don't load automatically, add the line in your initializer:

  ActionView::Base.send :include, ActiveMerchant::Billing::Integrations::ActionViewHelper

== Example Usage

== Special Thanks

Very special thanks to him.
